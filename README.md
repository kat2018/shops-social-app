To get started locally: 
- Fork this repo
- ```npm i``` to install all dependencies

Frontend: 
- React

Backend: 
- Express: server framework
- Body parser
- Nodemon: watch server changes
- Morgan: logging package
- Mongoose: Allow interaction with MongoDB

Approach used: 
- I focused on getting the boilerplates set up for React and for Express/Node/Mongo, then worke on the backend to see database and create CRUD.

Unsolved Problems: 
- Pending complete CRUD and work on nesting

Note to self: 
- Work on CRUD, nesting and start woking on React
